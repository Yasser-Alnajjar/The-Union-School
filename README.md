# The Union School
### This project is my graduation project from the (Errasoft) company, and this is one of the difficult works for me, not in writing the code and making the site, but this site was created during the period of my exams, and this made the project very difficult because I was studying for the exam and at the same time I write the codes for this project I hope you like it
===========================================================================
### Before I finish the conversation, I want to thank Engineer Mustafa for his interest in me during all this period, and that he is really a good brother and friend. I also want to thank my teachers, Engineer Osama Al-Zero, Engineer Ahmed Nasser, and Engineer Mahmoud Al-Gizawi. It is true that I do not find words to say in your presence, but our Lord knows that I love you so much. This gratitude will not suffice you for your right and your grace over me, after God, for what you have given me of knowledge
